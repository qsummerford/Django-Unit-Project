# Cable Connections

###What is Cable Connections?
Cable Connections is a website that allows cable companies to create networks and shows that are on that network.
In this project, I used Django models to allow the user to login and register, create, read, update, and delete their networks and shows.

###Features
- Create shows/networks
- View all your shows/networks
- Update your shows/networks
- Delete shows/networks
- Login/Sign up
- Admin Abilities
- See all Cable Companies' networks and shows if you're admin

###Usage
To start the website, you need to download homebrew and type in the terminal "python3 manage.py runserver" (on Mac) or "python manage.py runserver" (on Linux) then continue on the link the terminal gives you. 
To continue to the homepage or the login part of the project, you type at the end of the hyperlink, in the address bar, "/home"
